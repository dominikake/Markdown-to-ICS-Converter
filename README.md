# School Calendar to ICS Converter

## Overview

This is a personal project created to address the need for a digital version of the school calendar of events. The school calendars are usually distributed in printed format without electronic versions like .ics or .ical files. To bridge this gap, I used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract the text from the printed calendar and created this tool to convert it into a more usable format.

## Features

- Converts a text-based school calendar into ICS (iCalendar) format.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- Implementing data parsing and manipulation techniques.
- Using [re â€” Regular expression operation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) to search and extract specific patterns.
